Project: Titanic Survival Prediction  

ðŸ“Œ Project Objective
To predict passenger survival on the Titanic using machine learning techniques and analyze important features affecting survival.

---

 ðŸ“‚ Dataset Used
- Name: Titanic Dataset  
- Source: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic


### Tools & Libraries
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Scikit-Learn (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
- Jupyter Notebook


 Step-by-Step Workflow

### 1. Data Collection
- Titanic dataset downloaded from Kaggle

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing values
- Encode categorical variables
- Feature selection & engineering

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualizations to understand trends (age, gender, class)

### 4. Model Building
- Tried Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest
- Evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.

### 5. Results
- Best model: Random Forest with ~85% accuracy
